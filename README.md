A Home Assistant Theme that makes all border more modern, minimalistic and
tight.

## About

This is probably the most minimalistic theme out there (in terms of what
it actually does and changes).

It respects almost all design choices and colors from Home Assistant, except
one... the border/layering of the cards.

This theme makes everything just a little tiny bit more modern, consistent,
and tight.

Nothing special, but if you just like the default Home Assistant theme, this
might be a small variation that you might like.
